# Validation Functions
#
# These functions validate input values.
# In Python, functions prefixed with an underscore ("_") are private.
# Typically, unit tests should not be written for private functions.
# Don't write tests for them.
# Instead, write input validation tests for the calculation functions.

# Calculation Function: Retirement Age
#
# This function takes in a birth year and returns the retirement age.
# The retirement age is a (years, months) tuple.
#
# Notice the large number of if-else cases for birth years.
# Each one represents an equivalence class.
# Most conditions are single year values, but some represent ranges.
# There should be a test for each equivalence class and each boundary value.
# pytest.mark.parametrize can cover multiple inputs for the same test function.
#
# This function also validates inputs.
# Some inputs can be successfully parsed, but others will raise exceptions.
# There should be a test to cover each equivalence class of inputs, good and bad.
# pytest.raises makes testing exceptions easy.

# Hint: look at the "if" condition.

# This function also validates all inputs.
# Again, there should be a test to cover good and bad inputs.
# There will be many more input validation tests for this function.
